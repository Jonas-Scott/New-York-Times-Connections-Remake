## Project Summary
Our project will be a modified clone of the New York Times game “Connections” with 
4 levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard, extreme). Connections presents the 
player with a 4 by 4 grid of squares, each containing one word. The objective of 
the game is to find groups of four words that are in the same category. The player, 
using their mouse, selects 4 squares, then presses a submit button to check a guess. 
The game is over when either all 4 categories are guessed correctly, or 4 guesses 
are exhausted and the player loses.

Upon starting the application, an interface will pop up and the user can click on 
one of the 4 difficulty levels to select. Selecting a level will launch them into 
a game of connections. Once the game is over, the user will be taken back to the 
level selection screen. For each of the 4 levels, there will be one board of set 
words in set spots. This is to make each game more cohesive, as the positioning and 
respective categories in each game can make the game more or less challenging and 
clever.
